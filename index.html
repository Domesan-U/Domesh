            <h1>WHY STUDENTS MUST LEARN CPR?</h1>
            <p class="display-6">
                <ul type="disc">
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>WHO (World Health Organisation) in their article(dated 11th June 2021) says an estimated  17.9 million people died from CVDs (Cardio Vascular Diseases) in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths.  Of these deaths, nearly 50% were due to heart-attack.</li></p>  
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>This also include India.  Being an Indian it's our responsibility to take part-in the preventive measures to reduce these kind of deaths.</li></p> 
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>Out of the above mentioned stats on CVDs deaths, Nearly 90 per cent of the deaths were occurred before reaching the hospital and due to the lack of immediate CPR treatment.  If CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) performed immediately it can double the chance of survival of the person.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>Unfortunately, Only 30-40% of the people get the immediate help they need before professionals arrives.  It is practically difficult to get an immediate CPR (within 2 or 3 minutes) from the doctors or any medical graduates every time.</li></p>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img\data2.png">
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>This chart shows the increase in the rate of deaths due to heart attack.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>India has the largest youth population in the world, around 66 per cent of the total population is below the age of 35. Nearly 40 per cent of the Indian population is aged 13 to 35 years.  Out of these nearly 40-55 percent are non-medical degree holders (B.E, Arts and Science etc.) and many currently pursuing degree in various fields.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>And these youngsters doing great in their field but unfortunately only 10-20 per cent has the knowledge on first aid treatments and the remaining lacks knowledge on how to provide first aid treatment during heart attacks, strokes, choking etc.   And it become necessary to gain their knowledge in first aid treatment.  During heart attack a person near him can become doctor if he/she know the first aid treatment.  And it can increase the survival of a person.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>In this Generation, Heart attacks may happen to any person because of our food habits we practice now-a-days.  And it also increase the need of a person who know proper first-aid treatment around us to avoid such miserables.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>So it become necessary to introduce a life-saving subject as \"Emergency care (or) Basic First-aid\" for all non-medical students such as B.E. , Arts and science , etc.   It should be introduced as a mandatory subject with practical exposure and practical experiments.  Students should have this mandatory-subject at least for two semester.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>This subject should contain basic first-aid treatment for heart attacks, Choking etc.  It should also teach about Common Disease, Symptoms, Treatment with practical experiments on laboratory.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>It should be introduced for both private and government colleges with proper required facilities and should be taught by graduated medical teachers.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>It will increase the knowledge of each and every student on first-aid treatments.  And it has higher potential in reducing the deaths occurring due to lack of immediate first aid treatments.  And it will increase the quality of education.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>There is no thing such that only medical student should learn first-aid treatments. As it is the basic and much required subject than any other it should be made must learn subject in all colleges for all fields.  Each and every student should have the basic knowledge on basic first aid treatment. </li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>This subject has the potential to increase the quality of education among every student.  And it will make them a perfect socialized person.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>Unfortunately, only 10-20 per cent of the colleges teach this kind of subject to the students on their own interest through certain programs. </li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>Even Government conducts program in schools and colleges regarding What are the necessary things need to be done during medical emergency situation.  But as it has practical difficulties it cannot be conducted in each and every college.  If it is made as a mandatory subject, it will reach each and every student and we can ensure that every student gain proper knowledge on first-aid treatment.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>It\'s our duty to demand our request to government and other private institution that   Engineering and other non-medical fields need necessary medical subjects as mandatory subject.</li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>If it gets implemented, we can ensure that in the future lakhs of deaths would be prevented and we can see huge drop in the death rate due to heart attacks and etc. </li></p>
                    <p class="p">
                        <li>Basic motive of education is to help others.  And this subject has the high-potential to help others.</li></p>
